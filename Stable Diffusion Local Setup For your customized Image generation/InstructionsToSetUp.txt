By Barsat Khadka
Recommended only for systems with a dedicated GPU (preferably NVIDIA).
________________


1. Python Version Requirement
Ensure that Python 3.10 is installed on your system.
* If not, uninstall your current Python version and install Python 3.10.

2. For Intel GPUs or Low-Performance GPUs
If your system uses an Intel GPU or a less capable GPU, you’ll need OpenVINO.
Steps to Install OpenVINO:
1. Visit the OpenVINO Build Guide. (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Installation-on-Intel-Silicon) - installation process at end of page.
2. Choose your operating system and follow the detailed build instructions.
Note: The process can be time-consuming. Be patient!

3. Setting Up Stable Diffusion
   1. Go to Stable Diffusion WebUI. (https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-running) 
   2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
After Cloning the Repository:
   * Navigate to the models folder.
   * Inside models, go to the Stable-diffusion subfolder.
Download a Model:
   * Visit platforms like Hugging Face or other model providers, or use your own model.
   * Place the downloaded model file into the Stable-diffusion folder.

4. Editing webui-user.sh (You can download my file or do it yourself following the repo’s instructions)  
For Intel GPUs:
   * You might need to add flags like --skip-cuda-test if prompted by the terminal.
For NVIDIA GPUs:
   * Add the following line to webui-user.sh:
export COMMAND_LINE_ARGS="--api --share" and that;s enough.

5. Running the WebUI
Run the following command in the terminal:
Inside the folder where webUI is ./webui.sh
~The script might take some time to initialize.
~Once complete, a link will be generated in the terminal.
~Copy and paste this link into your browser to access Stable Diffusion.


. Troubleshooting
      * If the terminal prompts for specific flags (e.g., --skip-cuda-test):
      1. Open webui-user.sh again.
      2. Modify the export line to include the required flags.
